# Notes from ESP IDF docs:
#
# Partitions of type 'app' have to be placed at offsets aligned to 0x10000
#
# If Secure Boot V1 is enabled, then the partition of type app needs to have
# size aligned to 0x10000 (64 KB) boundary.
#
# If Flash Encryption is enabled, 'app', 'data:ota', 'data:nvs_keys' will
# be encrypted even if the 'encrypted' flag is not specified.
#
# Bootloader binary must fit in space before partition table. [...] no partition
# has an offset lower than CONFIG_PARTITION_TABLE_OFFSET + 0x1000 = 0x9000
